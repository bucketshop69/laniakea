# Laniakea - Your Unified DeFi Dashboard

**Stop juggling tabs. Start making smarter decisions.**

Laniakea is the unified interface for Solana DeFi that brings together all your positions, protocols, and insights in one powerful dashboard. No more switching between apps, no more scattered data, no more missed opportunities.

## 🚀 What Makes Laniakea Different?

DeFi is complex enough — your interface shouldn't be. Laniakea solves the three biggest problems facing DeFi users today:

1. **Fragmented Experience** - Jumping between Drift for perps, Meteora for LPs, and different protocols for everything else
2. **Lost Context** - Forgetting why you bought, missing news that moved the market, and not seeing how your positions interact
3. **Information Overload** - Ten tabs open, constant context switching, and decision fatigue

## 🎯 The Solution: Three Core Modules

### 1. **Actions** - Execute Smarter
One interface for all protocols. Swap, stake, LP, and borrow without the complexity.

### 2. **Profile** - See Everything  
Your complete DeFi journey. Every token, position, and trade across all protocols in one view.

### 3. **Feed** - Never Miss What Matters
The market moves fast, but your memory doesn't have to. Pin news, tweets, and events directly to price charts.
